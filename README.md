# Labryinth
The Labryinth is a application made to allow people to post their feelings and thoughts on a subject and to discover what others feel about various topics. It allows people to scroll to the point of getting where it feels like you are lost in a maze.
## Usage
The app starts by giving you two options to choose from dark/light mode and to create a post. When clicking the create post button there will be a drop-down that has you write a title, the post itself, and a tag to desrcibe the post. The former button will allow you to switch between a dark and light mode to allow the app to better suit your eyes for the time of day you are on it. The three buttons on each posts starting from top to bottom is the GOATED, On Fire, and Laughs. An extra feature is that when reloaded the most recent posts are carried to the top.

## Posts Buttons
To begin, the GOATED button shows the Greatest OF All Time, so the higher number the more GOATED the post is. The On Fire button is for if you dislike a post and to describe that the post might be going up in flames. The Laughs button is for if you find the post funny to show that you enjoyed the post and got a good laugh out of it.
