# Labryinth
The Labryinth is a application made to allow people to post their feelings and thoughts on a subject and to discover what others feel about various topics. It allows people to scroll to the point of getting where it feels like you are lost in a maze.
## Usage
The app starts by giving you two options to choose from dark/light mode and to create a post. When clicking the create post button there will be a drop-down that has you write a title, the post itself, and a tag to desrcibe the post. The former button will allow you to switch between a dark and light mode to allow the app to better suit your eyes for the time of day you are on it.
